	<h1> Homework 3</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>For the final project I will design a website that will</h2>
	<p>&#8594; My culinary skills </p>
	<br>
	<h2> 3 types of people that might want to visit my site are.</h2>
	<h4>3 types of people that want to vist my site are</h4>
	<p>&#8594; 3 types of people that want to visit my site are people who are staring out to cook or looking for recipes that are breaking down into simples steps with pictures provide. </p>
	<p>&#8594; People who want to know more about other culture foods. Explanning the definition and the backround of the dish </p>
	<p>&#8594; Exploring different cultures ingredients. Finding out the purpose and how to use it. Where they can find it, including having alternative ingredients for the dish</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Find three sites that reflect what you'd like to aspire to or emulate. Write a paragraph describing what about the site you want to draw influence from.</h2>

	<ol class="center">

		<h4>
			<li><a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/">Just One Cookbook</a>
			</li>
		</h4>
		<h4>
			<li><a href="http://www.honeysucklecatering.com/food-main/"> Honeysuckle</a>
			</li>
		</h4>
		<h4>
			<li><a href="https://www.maangchi.com/">Maangchi</a>
			</li>
		</h4>
	</ol>
	<p> These 3 sites emulate/inspire me to make my cooking sites very simple, detailed  and very easy to navigate/follow. There are some sites out there who would just write long paragraph of information. Information is great, but it great when it is breaking down into real easy steps. For these 3 sites it shows the explanation and detail hows its breaking down, which makes the cook the progress more easily.   </p>
